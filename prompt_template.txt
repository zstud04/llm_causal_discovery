Imagine a typical {place}. Now consider these two statements about that place:

STATEMENT 1:
{causal_value}.

STATEMENT 2:
{counterfactual_value}

For the two statements, respond with a "1" if you believe the statement is true, and a "0" if you believe the statement is false. Separate your two responses by a comma.
