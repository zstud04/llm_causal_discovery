Study Title: Discovery Procedure for Causal Reasoning in LLMs

Principal Investigator: Gary Lupyan (Phone: (608) 262-4333) (Email: lupyan@wisc.edu)


Description of the research

You are invited to participate in a research study about how reasoning abilities are different in humans and large language models like chat-GPT. 



The purpose of the research is to understand how what differences exist in different kinds of causal reasoning between humans and large language models.



This study will include English-speaking adults from the psychology department participant pool.



This research will be conducted online.

        

What will my participation involve?
If you decide to participate in this research, you will be asked to generate some statements and imagine some different scenarios based on directions you will see. 

Your participation will last approximately 15-30 minutes.

       

Recording information

The experimenter will notify you if the specific task you are doing includes recording of your voice. Any audio recordings will be accessible only to approved research personnel or may be transcribed by a professional transcription service. The recordings will be kept indefinitely and stored on a secure server.

        

Are there any risks to me?

There is a risk of a confidentiality breach. Participants may become upset or experience discomfort. Participants may become fatigued or frustrated due to the length of the study.

        

Are there any benefits to me?

You are not expected to benefit directly from participating in this study.

        

Will I be compensated for my participation?

You will receive research study credit appropriate to the length of the study: 3 points per hour in increments of ¾ points).

         

 



How will my confidentiality be protected?

This study is confidential. Neither your name or any other identifiable information will be published. Raw data will be made available to research personnel approved as part of this protocol. De-identified data will be posted on open science repositories.
